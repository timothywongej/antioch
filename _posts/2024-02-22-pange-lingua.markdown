#### 2. Pange Lingua

*One of the five beautiful hymns St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) composed in honor of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament at Pope Urban IV's (1261-1264) request when the Pope first established the Feast of Corpus Christi in 1264.*

*This version is by Matt Maher*

<br>
Sing my tongue, my Saviour's glory, 
of Your flesh the mystery sing. 
Of Your blood all price exceeding, 
shed by You, immortal king.

Destined for the world's redemption, 
from a noble womb to spring. 
Of a pure and spotless virgin 
born for us on earth below.

You as man with man conversing, 
stayed, the seeds of truth to sow. 
Then You closed in solemn order 
wondrously Your life to show. 

Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity, 
bread of the angels, taste of eternity. 
Source of all strength and the summit of faith. 
Your love on display. We behold the mystery.

On the night of that last supper, 
seated with Your chosen band.
You, the paschal victim eating, 
first fulfills the law's command. 

Then as food to all Your brethren, 
gave Yourself with your own hands. 
Word made flesh the bread of nature, 
by Your word to flesh he turned.

Wine into Your blood You changed, 
what though our sense no change discerned. 
Only be the heart in earnest, 
faith her lesson quickly learns.

Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity, 
bread of the angels, taste of eternity. 
Source of all strength and the summit of faith. 
Your love on display. We behold the mystery.
