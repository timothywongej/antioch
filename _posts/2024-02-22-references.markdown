#### 2. Christocentric 

**[Dei Verbum](https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html), Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation (Vatican II)**
<br>
*‘Dei Verbum’ means Word of God in Latin. The significance of this document, to understand the heart of the Church and how She understand divine revelation – how God reveals Himself to us, through His Son, Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh. This is an extremely helpful synthesis if one is unsure of how to approach scripture.*
- Watch this short 6 min [Bishop Barron video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgsIK1avs6U&t=2s) for an introduction

**Sacred Scripture**
<br>
*Read scripture, pray with scripture, and let God speak to you!*
> John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him”

> Philippians 2:7: “but he emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, death on a cross. 

**[Spe Salvi][spe salvi], Pope Benedict XVI**
<br>
*As introduced above.*
- Paragraph 39 - Bernard of Clairvaux coined the marvellous expression: *Impassibilis est Deus, sed non incompassibilis* – God cannot suffer, but he can suffer with. Man is worth so much to God that he himself became man in order to suffer with man in an utterly real way.

#### 3. Eucharistic
 
**[Ecclesia de Eucharistia](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_20030417_eccl-de-euch.html), Pope John Paul II**
<br>
*An encyclical letter written by Pope John Paul II on the Eucharist in its relationship with the Church. Do read to meditate and begin to live a deeply Eurcharistic life.* 


- The sacrifice of calvary is the sacrifice of the Eucharist, Ecclesia de Eucharistia 12 

> The Church constantly draws her life from the redeeming sacrifice; she approaches it not only through faith-filled remembrance, but also through a real contact, since this sacrifice is made present ever anew, sacramentally perpetuated, in every community which offers it at the hands of the consecrated minister. The Eucharist thus applies to men and women today the reconciliation won once for all by Christ for mankind in every age. “The sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are one single sacrifice”. Saint John Chrysostom put it well: “We always offer the same Lamb, not one today and another tomorrow, but always the same one. For this reason the sacrifice is always only one... Even now we offer that victim who was once offered and who will never be consumed”.

> The Mass makes present the sacrifice of the Cross; it does not add to that sacrifice nor does it multiply it. What is repeated is its memorial celebration, its “commemorative representation” (memorialis demonstratio), which makes Christ's one, definitive redemptive sacrifice always present in time. The sacrificial nature of the Eucharistic mystery cannot therefore be understood as something separate, independent of the Cross or only indirectly referring to the sacrifice of Calvary.


* A living sacrifice, Ecclesia de Eucharistia 13 

> In giving his sacrifice to the Church, Christ has also made his own the spiritual sacrifice of the Church, which is called to offer herself in union with the sacrifice of Christ. This is the teaching of the Second Vatican Council concerning all the faithful: “Taking part in the Eucharistic Sacrifice, which is the source and summit of the whole Christian life, they offer the divine victim to God, and offer themselves along with it”. (See also [Lumen Gentium](https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html) 11)

<br>
*A 5 minute video commemorating the 200th year of Catholicism in Singapore. Pst there are more detailed ones, please watch.*

**[Spe Salvi][spe salvi], Pope Benedict XVI**
<br>
*Is Christian hope individualistic? In paragraphs 13 to 15 Pope Benedict draws on patristic theology and the profound Catholic understanding of communion to illustrate the nature of Christian hope being one of communal salvation.* 

**[The Motherhood of the Church](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/638236.The_Motherhood_of_the_Church), Henri de Lubac** 
<br>
*Henri de Lubac is considered to be an important theologian of the 20th century along side Joseph Ratzinger and Hans Urs von Balthasar. He was appointed by Pope John XXIII as a member of the Second Vatican Council’s preparatory commission in 1959. Pope John Paul II named de Lubac a cardinal in 1983. However, before all this, at one point, he was sanctioned from teaching and writing by the Church. Yet, he showed extraordinary patience and obedience rather than rebellion. He is famously said to have left in tears, saying “She (the Church) is still our Mother”*.

**[Familiaris Consortio](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_jp-ii_exh_19811122_familiaris-consortio.html#_ftn39), Pope John Paul II**
<br>
*An Apostolic exhortation of Pope John Paul II on the role of the Christian Family in the Modern World.*

- Familiaris Consortio 13 
> This revelation reaches its definitive fullness in the gift of love which the Word of God makes to humanity in assuming a human nature, and in the sacrifice which Jesus Christ makes of Himself on the Cross for His bride, the Church. In this sacrifice there is entirely revealed that plan which God has imprinted on the humanity of man and woman since their creation; the marriage of baptized persons thus becomes a real symbol of that new and eternal covenant sanctioned in the blood of Christ. 

- Familiaris Consortio 16
> In virginity or celibacy, the human being is awaiting, also in a bodily way, the eschatological marriage of Christ with the Church, giving himself or herself completely to the Church in the hope that Christ may give Himself to the Church in the full truth of eternal life. The celibate person thus anticipates in his or her flesh the new world of the future resurrection. See Also Mt 22:30

<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
