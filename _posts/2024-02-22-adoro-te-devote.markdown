#### 1. Adoro Te Devote

*One of the five beautiful hymns St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) composed in honor of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament at Pope Urban IV's (1261-1264) request when the Pope first established the Feast of Corpus Christi in 1264.*

*This version is by Matt Maher*

<br>
Jesus, God in hiding
Whom I do adore
Masked by these bare shadows
Shape and nothing more
See, Lord, at Thy service
Lo lies here a heart
Lost, all lost in wonder
At the God Thou art

Seeing, touching, tasting, easily deceived
But faith that comes by hearing,
that shall be believed
What God's Son has told me, 
I take for truth I do
For truth Himself speaks truly,
or there's nothing true

Adoro Te Devote 
(Thee we adore, O hidden Saviour)

Oh Thou, our reminder of Christ crucified
Living Bread, the life of us 
for whom He died,
Lend this life to me, then:
satisfy my mind
There be all the sweetness 
man was meant to find.

Adoro Te Devote 
(Thee we adore, O hidden Saviour)

I am not like Thomas,
wounds I cannot see,
But can plainly call you Lord and God as He: 
Lead me to a deeper faith,
daily nearer move 
daily make me hope more, 
daily make me love

Saviour whom I look at 
shrouded here below, 
God I beg You, send me
what I thirst for so, 
Only just to see You, 
face to face in light
And be blest forever with thy glory's sight

Adoro Te Devote 
(Thee we adore, O hidden Saviour)
